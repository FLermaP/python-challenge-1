# Python-Challenge-1
## "Simple" Food Ordering Menu
### This Menu demonstrates the use of :
  * Lists and Directory structures,
  * List comprehension,
  * Nested :
    * Match-case, 
    * if-else,
    * while loops
    * for loops.

### It also makes use of:
  *   Creation of Dividers and "Space" Strings by multipliying a character, or blank space. 
  *   Use of an Operating System function to clear the screen ( part of presentation )
  *   Variable re-Typing
  *   String check to confirm it holds only Alphabetic values, or Numbers (0-9) as text
  *   Print Formating of numerical values
    
## Notes:
  * Python 3.10 or later is required to run the "match-case", Microsoft Python IntelliSense (Pylance) at the time of this update is running Python 3.9.13 and throws a Syntax Error on match-case instructions
